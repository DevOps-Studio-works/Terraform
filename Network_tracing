The "Errno 99" error typically indicates a "Cannot assign requested address" issue, which means the code is trying to connect to an IP address and port combination that is not available or not valid. In the context of IMAP4_SSL (a module used for secure email retrieval over IMAP), this can be related to network configuration or the way you're specifying the host and port.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Check the IMAP Server Hostname and Port**:
   Ensure that you're specifying the correct IMAP server hostname (e.g., `imap.example.com`) and port (usually 993 for secure IMAP over SSL). Double-check that the hostname is resolving to the correct IP address.

2. **Hostname Resolution**:
   Verify that your system can resolve the IMAP server's hostname to a valid IP address. You can use the `ping` or `nslookup` command to test this.

3. **Network Connection**:
   Ensure that your network connection is functioning correctly. You may want to test other network-related operations on your system to confirm that there are no issues with connectivity.

4. **Firewall or Security Software**:
   Check if any firewall or security software on your system is blocking outgoing connections to the IMAP server. You may need to configure your firewall to allow outgoing connections on the specified IMAP port.

5. **TLS/SSL Configuration**:
   If you're using IMAP4_SSL, make sure that the IMAP server you're connecting to requires a secure SSL/TLS connection. If the server does not support SSL, you should use the regular IMAP4 library without SSL.

6. **Port Availability**:
   Confirm that the specified port (993 for secure IMAP) is available and not in use by another application. You can check this using tools like `netstat` or `lsof`.

7. **Proxy or VPN**:
   If you are using a proxy or VPN, make sure it is properly configured and not causing connection issues.

8. **Network Stack Configuration**:
   Review the network stack configuration on your system, and ensure that it is properly configured to handle SSL/TLS connections. Also, check for any system-wide network configurations that might be affecting your connection.

9. **Update Libraries and Dependencies**:
   Ensure that your IMAP4_SSL library and related dependencies are up to date. Sometimes, updating the library can resolve compatibility issues.

10. **Error Handling**:
    Implement proper error handling in your code to catch and handle exceptions gracefully. This can provide more detailed information about the error, which may help with troubleshooting.

If you are working within a specific programming environment or framework, it's important to refer to the relevant documentation for any environment-specific considerations. Also, you should provide more context or error messages if you need further assistance with this issue.
